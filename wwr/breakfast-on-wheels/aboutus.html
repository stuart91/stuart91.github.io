    <p> Being a college student myself, I know the struggle of time. With those early mornings and late nights,
        trying to finish those assignments that seem to never end and preparing to quizes and exams at the same time.
        The life of a college student can be stressful! Sometimes, you choose to sacrifice certain things in your life
        get to class on time. Whether that is sacrificing sleep, or sacrificing food. </p>

    <p> In fact, Studies show that 60% of students skip breakfast. The meal that has been proven time and time again to be
        the most important meal of the day. When time gets the best of students, they choose to go without breakfast.
        A result that can cause students to struggle with the concentration they need while in school. I have been in the same
        situation as the majority of those college students. The entire time, I thought to myself how great it would be to have 
        a food truck to come by on campus that only sells breakfast food. But, not any type of breakfast food. It would have to be
        quick, on the go foods. Which is why I created "Breakfast on Wheels". A food truck that sells quick breakfast foods for
        students who have enough to deal with in their busy lives. </p>
