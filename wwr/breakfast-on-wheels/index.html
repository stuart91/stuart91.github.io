    <h2>
        Why Visit Us?
    </h2>
    <p>
    The main reasoning behind people from all over town come and visit Breakfast on Wheels is to see the
    different types of amazing goods that we have to offer. The advantage Breakfast on Wheels has over other
    fast-food restaurants is that we are mobile. Having our restaurant in a food truck means the ability to
    take our food to our customers. We change our locations throughout the week and are usually near construction
    sites and college campuses. We sell breakfast foods that are quick to make and quick to eat. We believe if our
    customers must wait longer than 2 minutes for their breakfast, then they are waiting too long. </p>

    <p> Having a guarantee of providing quick, on-the-go foods means foods such as Pop Tarts, bagels with spreads, breakfast bars,
    yogurts, granola, and healthier options such as apples, bananas, and other different fruits. If they have a few minutes
    to spare before class, we have an assortment of cereals with different types of milk to choose from. Providing a quick
    breakfast for them means providing the fuel and energy that students need to help excel in their studies and to better
    their future!
