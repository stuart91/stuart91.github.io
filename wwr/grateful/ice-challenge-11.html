    <h2>Psalms 100:3-4</h2>

<div>
    <p>
    Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, <br>
    and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.<br></p>
    
    <p>
    Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: <br>
    be thankful unto him, and bless his name.<br></p>
