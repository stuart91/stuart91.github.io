      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>With Breakfast on Wheels, we provide a quick breakfast for students who don't have the time to eat breakfast at home. 
         Providing breakfast on campus means students have the fuel and energy needed to help excel in their studies and to better
         their future.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Studies show that 60% of students skip breakfast. The meal that has been proven to be the most important meal of the day. 
        When time gets the best of students, they choose to go without breakfast. A result that can cause students to struggle with
        the concentration they need while in school. With “Breakfast on Wheels”, we take the breakfast to students on campus.
        Being the breakfast of taco trucks means quick, on-the-go foods such as Pop Tarts, bagels with spreads, breakfast bars,
        yogurts, granola, and healthier options such as apples, bananas, and other different fruits. If they have a few minutes
        to spare before class, we have an assortment of cereals with different types of milk to choose from. </p>  <!-- change this -->

          <b>Why people come to this site.</b>
        </p>
        The main reason why people will come to my website is to see the different types of amazing foods that Breakfast on Wheels
        has to offer. We will have the majority of quick, on the go breakfast foods available in under a minute. We want to keep things
        quick because of how busy students are. If they are waiting longer than 1-2 minutes, then they are waiting too long.
        
        Breakfast on Wheels does not stay in one consistent place. We will have a schedule of where we will be throughout the week.
        We will mostly be around heavier populated areas around the morning rush hour. Local college campuses in particular. 
        These locations can change frequently, or where we are wanted most. If someone has a location they would like to recommend us,
        they are more than welcome to message us in our recommend box!

        </p>
        What type of breakfast food is provided? Does the food menu ever change? What locations are you at? Do you ever go to new places?
        Can we recommend food items? Any dairy free or gluten free foods? Are there certain places we can request to have you? Do you cater?

          <b>Why will visitors come to this site instead of another for information?</b>
        </p>
        Everyone has heard of a taco food truck. But how many people have heard of a breakfast truck? It is an idea that is so simple and not really used.
        The best place to have a breakfast food truck is near college campuses. Going on our website will help our customers know what foods we have and where we will be that day.
